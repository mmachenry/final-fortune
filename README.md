Final Fortune
---

This is a program designed to calculate the probability of a given deck of
Magic: the Gathering cards producing a first-turn win against a "goldfish"
opponent by simulating an arbitrarily large number of games. It will then use
a genetic algorithm to produce the optimal deck legal under a given set of 
deck construction rules to maximize the probability of a first-turn win.
